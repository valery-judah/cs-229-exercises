# CS229 Exercises and Learning Journal

This repository contains additional exercises, notes, and resources to support learning from [Stanford’s CS229: Machine Learning](https://cs229.stanford.edu/).

This repository is (hopefully) intended for learners who want to go beyond passive note-taking by actively working through extra problems and reflecting on their thought process.

While inspired by CS229, the materials here are independently created and not officially affiliated with Stanford University.

What is ready: LinReg, LogReg, ...

## Purpose

Let's start with problems that I can see for me now. CS229 is high-level theory — it is not problem-oriented and it does not always provide step‑by‑step exercises.  

Hopefully, this project helps fill that gap by providing (in future versions):

- Targeted Practice: A set of exercises with solutions to complement the theory with specific problems.
- Guided Walkthroughs: Step-by-step derivations and algorithmic guides that break down complex concepts.
- Reasoning Traces: Records of how conclusions were reached, including alternative approaches.
- Resource Collection: A collection of links, papers, and supplementary materials.

## Learning Goals

- Build an intuition for core ML methods.
- Practice problem-solving beyond the official course materials.
- Develop a personal ontology of ML concepts and how they connect.
- Maintain a reproducible record of the learning journey.

## Repository Structure

- `exercises/` – Self-created problem sets with solutions and discussion.
- `walkthroughs/` – Step-by-step derivations and algorithmic guides.
- `notes/` – Concise summaries of lectures, readings, and key proofs.
- `resources/` – Links, articles, papers, and reference sheets.
- `tools/` – Small utilities (e.g., plotting, data loaders) used across exercises.

## How to Use This Repo

1. Start with a concept you’re studying in CS229 (e.g., linear regression, SVMs).
2. Read the corresponding **walkthrough** to get a step-by-step path through the math.
3. Attempt the **exercises**; check **solutions** only after writing your own.
4. Capture insights and open questions in **notes**.
5. Use **resources** to go deeper or cross-check understanding.
